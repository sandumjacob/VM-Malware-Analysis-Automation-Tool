 This Python program serves as a tool for automatically executing and analyzing malware samples in a VM enviroment. 
 It can work with one VM on a single machine, or multiple VMs each on a different machine.

                        |                          |

   |         +------------+       |           |
   |         |                    |           |
   |         |                    |           |
   |         |                    |           |
+--v--+      |                    |           |
| M1  |   +--v--+        +-----+<-+           |
+-----+   | M2  |        | M3  |           +--v--+
          +-----+        +-----+           | M4  |
                                           +-----+
```

From the Sampler Manager, one can remotely and automatically tell a VM to execute a malware sample and log the traffic. This allows for the automation of malware traffic collection.
